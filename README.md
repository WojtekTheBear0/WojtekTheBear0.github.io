## About

I'm an undergraduate at Worcester State University looking to enter a PhD program related to computational science following my graduation. My interests primarily lie in machine learning and numerical simulations. Any and all inquiries are welcome at my email.

## Short Summary of Previous and Current Research Projects
- **Astrochemistry Parameter Model Optimization** â€“ Created a neural network to optimize parameters in NAUTILUS, a Fortran90 ODE astrochmistry simulation model, using observed data of molecular abundances. (Stomski, Burkhardt et al, in prep)
- **Data Analysis & Visualization of OMC-1 Light Polarization** â€“ Reverse engineered magnetism smoothing algorithm to analyze ALMA and JCMT telescope data of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC-1).
- **Modifying Astrochemical Model to Simulate Shock Chemistry** â€“ Adjusted NAUTILUS source code to emulate shock chemistry.
